UI/UX for Social media Pro app – from moodboard to design system

Soulcial is a concept-driven social media application designed to enable people to connect, collaborate, share ideas, and communicate seamlessly.
This case study documents the complete UI/UX journey — from visual inspiration to wireframes, high-fidelity designs, interactions, and a structured design system.

📌 Project Overview
Soulcial focuses on creating a clean, intuitive, and emotionally engaging social experience.
